# Welcome to Issue Tracker
Welcome to the Issue Tracker user guide docs! These docs will guide you on using ConnectNow as a user.

## Registering

First, go to <https://issuetracker.connectnow.org.uk/register>.

Fill in the details asked of you. You will be sent a verification email. Click the button in the email to verify your account and start using Issue Tracker.

## Logging in

To log in, go to <https://issuetracker.connectnow.org.uk/login> and provide your email address and password.

## Resseting your password

To reset your password, go to <https://issuetracker.connectnow.org.uk/forgot-password>, provide your email address when asked, and follow the on-screen instructions.

## Issuing API tokens

Issue Tracker is primarly interacted with via its very powerful API. Some endpoints require authorization, which you can do by issuing yourself a token.

If you're unsure of what this section means, contact your developer team.

You can issue API tokens to access Issue Tracker via API. First, [log in](#logging-in). Click on "Create a new token" to create a new token. The token will only be shown once; keep it guarded as you would any other secret.

Head over to the [API docs](../developer-guide/api/) for more info on using the API.

## Confirming notification subscriptions

When you or someone signs you up to receive notifications about a specific issue or category, you will be sent only 1 email to confirm you want to indeed get such notifications.

To agree to receive notifications about a given issue or category, click the button in the email within 2 days.

To no longer receive emails about a given issue, simply ignore the email. Do note, after 2 days you will not be able to subscribe to the issue again.
