# Welcome to Chat by ConnectNow
Welcome to the Chat user guide docs! These docs will guide you on using ConnectNow as a user.

## Joining a conversation

If you're provided with the link and password to a chat running on ConnectNow, you can join it.

::: tip
Every secure ConnectNow chat URL starts with **https://**. Make sure yours does too to keep your information safe.
:::

### For the first time

1. When prompted, fill in the chat password that was provided to you. If your link already contained the chat password, you will not see this screen.
2. Fill in your name, surname, and email address. This will be used to identify who you are in the chat, and all chat members will be able to see this.
3. Join the chat.

### Rejoining a conversation you were previously a part of

Sometimes, and especially if you haven't joined a chat in a long time, you may be asked to re-join the chat.

1. When prompted, fill in the chat password that was provided to you. If your link already contained the chat password, you will not see this screen.
2. Fill in your name, surname, and email address. This will be used to identify who you are in the chat, and all chat members will be able to see this.
3. Check your email for an authentication code. When prompted, fill in this authentication code.
4. Join the chat.

## Leaving a conversation

To leave the conversation, open the [sidebar](#sidebar) on the right side by pressing the "i" icon in the top-right of the navbar. Then, on the sidebar home, scroll to the bottom and choose "Leave chat".

When you leave a conversation, you will still be able to later rejoin by [rejoining a conversation you were previously a part of](#rejoining-a-conversation-you-were-previously-a-part-of). Regardless of whether or not you rejoin, other members of the chat will be able to see that you were a previous participant.

## Messaging

ConnectNow Chat is a super powerful messaging platform, with all the bells and whistles you'd expect of a modern system.

### Sending text

To send text, use the input bar at the bottom to input your text. To actually send it, you can either press enter, or the "Send" button to the right of the input field.

### Sending files, images, videos, and more

To send files, select files by clicking on the paperclip icon just to the right of the text input towards the bottom of the screen.

On mobile, you can access your camera and phone album to take pictures (or choose ones you already have on your phone) and send them.

If you are on desktop, you can also drag and drop files onto the chat area to send them.

Depending on the browser you are on, there is native support of PDF files, images, GIFs, videos, and audio files.

## Sidebar

The sidebar serves as a central control panel while you are in a chat. You can open and close it by toggling the "i" icon on the top right to open it, and the "x" icon to then close it.

### About this chat
