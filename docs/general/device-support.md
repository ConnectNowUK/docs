# Device Support

This page describes ConnectNow's device support.

## Supported Browsers

We do our best to make sure ConnectNow works on as many browsers and devices as possible, but supporting every combination is an impossible task. Any modern browser that follows standards should work, especially anything based on [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/), like [Brave Browser](https://brave.com).

## Progressive Web Apps

All of ConnectNow's clients are Progressive Web Apps. This means they can be 'installed' locally on your device, similar to an App, only without the applicable App Store. Exactly how this behaves depends on your operating system, so we've provided links for some of the most popular browsers and operating systems.

::: tip Note - 18 Jan 2024
Until late 2023, Apple were decidedly anti-PWA and refused to support the popular standard, preferring that all 'apps' go through their App Store. Safari 17 finally added support for PWAs. If you're an Apple user looking for the option, make sure your OS and Safari are both up to date.
