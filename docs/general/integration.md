# Integration

This page describes ConnectNow's integration capabilities.

## REST API

ConnectNow's backend services run on a standard REST API pattern. Therefore, any client with credentials can send requests and get responses.

::: warning IMPORTANT NOTE
For security reasons, ConnectNow's production instance has an allow list for request origins. Please [contact us](mailto:info@connectnow.org.uk) with the URL/IP of your client, and we'll add it to the allow list.
:::

Check out our various API documentation pages to find out what calls are available for service: [Chat](/chat/developer-guide/api/), [Queue System](/queue-system/developer-guide/api/), [Issue Tracker](/issue-tracker/developer-guide/api/)

## Direct Integration

We're always looking to add new integrations in to ConnectNow. If you use a specific system and require a bespoke integration, please [contact us](mailto:info@connectnow.org.uk) with the details. Some examples include ITSM systems for ticket/incident management, or device management tools.

## Flow builder

::: tip
This is a future development for ConnectNow. We're working on it, so hold tight!
:::

The [Flow Builder](/general/flow-builder.html). allows you to integrate any system with a REST API with ConnectNow, using a powerful but simple to use visual interface.
